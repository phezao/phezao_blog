Hi there, I'm Philip Oka, a guy passionated on entrepreneurship, innovation, technology. I'm inspired
to help entrepreneurs create a better world, a world where innovation brings fairness and justice for everybody,
where the only problems are the stupid problems.

If you're interested in technology, entrepreneurship, innovation, personal finance
then maybe you'll like this place. My goal in this blog is to run experiments in myself,
to answer a couple of questions I have (and I believe other people might have as well),
to give my point of view and recommendations, tips and tricks and also do some reviews on
things I also enjoy.

Whether you're building your own startup, working for one or aspire to build one someday, it's undeniable that information is crucial. With so much data, you can make better decisions, predict the future and create better experiences. If you ever come across the question from the title, I hope that at the end of this post you have a clear understanding on rating systems for your startup, or at least some notion so that you can push the discussion further.

I'm going to try to answer these couple of questions throughout this post:
- **What are the most commonly used rating system?**
- **What are the Pros and Cons of each system?**
- **How to choose a rating system?**
- **How can I keep my rating system reliable?**

Let's get started!

## What are the most commonly used rating system?
### Star system
It's somewhat a visual likert scale, very commonly used across the internet (Amazon, Zomato, Airbnb, Uber), so you have 1 star representing poor rating and 5 stars as the highest rating possible.

### Binary system
This rating system simplifies to either 0 or 1, so Instagram have their likes, or in some cases in -1, 0 and 1, like Youtube, Netflix, Spotify, Reddit, that you can either like, dislike or do nothing.

Obviously there are tweaks and variations in each one of them, because the more you simplify a rating system, the more information gets missed or confused. That's why in very large cases, for example, star systems create specific criterias so users can rate specific areas of the process/product/service.

## What are the Pros and Cons of each system?
### Star System
**Pros** \
Qualitative reviews can stimulate and increase user engagement, nurturing a community inside your business/project. Look at Airbnb, Zomato, Yelp, those platforms stimulate the user to give feedback and help each other on their shared interest (finding a good restaurant).

**Cons** \
The more complex the process to review, the less stimulated the user will feel to give their feedback (unless it's a pretty bad experience). I believe that getting feedback from the users can be a challenge, mainly because our first instinct is to just do nothing. So it can be very difficult to collect reviews if you create too much complexity (too many criterias) to your star system.

Now if you're thinking about simplifying your rating to just an overall star system, there's the risk of getting wrong feedback. If you're an e-commerce and have a star system for your product, the user will (by default) evaluate the whole experience, not your product. So if the shipment is late because of the delivery company, the low rating might be counting that. That's why it can be important to have your customers to write reviews, if they complain about the shipping, you know where's the problem.

### Binary System
**Pros** \
Requires very little mental effort for the user to put on, so you will certainly will have more data.

**Cons** \
It doesn't differentiates the "it was an ok experience, didn't hate it", from a "THIS IS REALLY AMAZING". Your customer will fill the rating with a "like" even if it was just ok and that can mislead other people and make your rating biased.

## How do I choose a rating system?
Choose your rating system based on customer behavior and objectives! Think about these couple of questions for a moment:

- **Is there any serious risk/consequence involved in the transaction?** \
The bigger the risk involved in the transaction, the more important are the reviews for the customer. If you're choosing a hotel for vacations for example, you will spend some time reading the reviews and looking at the ratings. For low risk transactions like a Youtube video, a movie on netflix, you can benefit from a binary system.
- **Does your customer could benefit from personalized experience from your product?** \
If your customer could benefit from personalized experience, for example the recommended movies in netflix , or the videos on Youtube, then you should probably stick to binary system. This way you can collect more data to make predictions about the users taste. A Binary system will force the user to take a side, and that will give you enough data to make a decision like that (although it could be biased).
- **Does the service/product I offer is seen like a commodity (low differentiation)?** \
If your product/service is seen by the customer as a commodity, a low differentiation product/service, then it may not need too many criterias to assess its performance. For example, for Uber a simple five-star system is good enough to verify which drivers are good or not, and even if it's not that precise, it doesn't have to go so deep in the criterias.

## How can I keep my rating system reliable?
But a problem can come up. What if people start giving good ratings even though it was an average experience? After some time, your ratings could plateau to a 4.3 score and even with a bad review or a really good one, it would remain the 4.3. How can you keep the score still reliable?

A couple of things that could be implemented:

- To avoid the plateau, start looking at the past reviews from the user to give different weights on their rating. If a user always gives good or bad reviews, than you can reduce its weight to balance the total score.

- Also, if your ratings are too high, and the product/service is not delivering an optimal experience, the customer will lose trust on your business. So to put that in perspective, use a normal distribution on the products/services of that specific category, that way you have the true average, and maybe display it to the customer, this way it would be much clearer who would be above average or not. You could also display the current position of that product/service compared to the others in the normal distribution and tag differently the top 10% (superhost on Airbnb for example).

- Another interesting tip from another indie hacker is to maybe include and analyze the number of people who have favorited that product/service. Maybe that could be taken to account on the score calculation (haven't tested, just a theory). I would really suggest taking a look at what he did, it's a pretty interesting reading.

- Another suggestion could be to take into account only the most recent data on the score, this way you may have more reliability on the actual performance of the product/service recently.

## Conclusion
To conclude, I believe there's no perfect rating system, you have to choose the one that best fits your business. Choose it according to the customer behavior and your business goals, test it and you'll see if you made a good choice.

This is my first post ever, so I really hope you enjoyed the post if you made it until here. I would appreciate some feedback. Thanks! ðŸ˜€

This will be my first book review. I want to have the habit of reading, I know there’s tons of benefits of it and so I started googling and looking at amazon’s reviews for a good book. I’ve created a pretty big list of books I want to read and by looking at some Amazon reviews, [this book](https://amzn.to/2Dckin5) had like almost 5 stars, so I went on it.

This is a completely self-help book. I didn’t know exactly what to expect, but as I was drawn by the reviews I wanted to give a shot, and it was an ok book. I mean, if you’re into maybe some motivational books maybe you would enjoy more than I did. Nothing in the book is so groundbreaking or eye-opening, at least it wasn’t for me (could be for you)

Here are the ideas that stuck with me from [The Magic of Thinking Big by David Schwartz](https://amzn.to/2Dckin5):

- The first step to achieve something is to believe and visualize you can achieve that. This book firmly states about the believe within yourself and to visualize it. I think that in some ways that is true. If you believe you can do something, your behaviors, mindset and actions may start going towards your goal, but that only starts if you believe enough.

- Value is not only on the present moment, but on the potential it can get. Ask yourself “What can be done in the future? What can I do to add value?”. That’s something that’s also obvious but sometimes we might forget that things that have low value now can become valuable depending the way to play with it.

- Run towards continuous improvement, the famous japanese word “Kaizen”. Ask yourself “How can I do a better job today?”, you can always improve. Something I disagree with the author is that compulsive need to improve in everything. I believe that you should improve in what matters to you, and remember that there’s always room to improve more. It’s that famous thing about focusing on your strengths rather than you weaknesses.

- “You are what you think you are”. That’s like the story you tell yourself of who you are. What are saying to yourself? If you believe you’re not worth it, you’re not that smart, you can’t succeed, you’re going to fulfill your own words. Once you assume an identity, your behaviors and actions are going to try to align with that identity to reinforce it, otherwise you become a gigantic living fraud.

- I don’t really remember if this is how it’s stated in the book, but the message I got from one of the chapters is that enthusiasm generates enthusiasm. In other words, your enthusiasm inspire people to work, to follow you, to act. I firmly believe to pursue what generates enthusiasm, because that might be passion in disguise.

- To become an effective leader, one of the most important things you can learn is to be empathetic, that improves on emotional intelligence, decision making, motivation and communication. And focus to be the best leader you can be, if you don’t have the profile, look for someone who has. “The simplest way to get high-level performance is to be sure the master copy is worth duplicating”

- One of the things that was actually really interesting is in the last chapter of the book, about leadership. The author talks about how much deep thinking a leader requires and that anyone would benefit to have the habit of deeply thinking for at least 30 minutes by yourself, in silence, alone, without distractions, thinking about your problems, decisions and strategies in life and business.

Anyway, these were the main ideas I extracted from this book. I personally didn’t thought was that good like the Amazon reviews said, but maybe if you need a little motivation and think the ideas here were interesting, go for it!

I can totally understand why people would rate high on this, not exactly my style, but it was ok! I went through all of it because I have this habit of finishing what I started.

Hope you enjoyed and Think big!

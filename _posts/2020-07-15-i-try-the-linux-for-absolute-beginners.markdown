What’s up? So this week I decided to try one of the Udemy courses called “Linux for Absolute Beginners!” (I’ll leave the link of the course right [here](https://www.udemy.com/course/linux-system-admin/)) and share with you how was my experience with this course, if it was worth it or not? What were the things I like and/or dislike about the course and if I recommend it.

**Ready for this? Let’s get started!**

## Beginning

To start off, I know very little about Linux, just the very basic commands (like cp, mv, rm, cd), so I’m going to assess the course just as if I knew nothing about it.

If you don’t have Linux, it’s pretty cool that the professor show you how to install on your machine as a virtual machine and as a dual boot, so don’t worry if you’re a windows user and wanted to try out.

The first few videos are very clear, it can be sometimes a little repetitive, but that’s a good thing for beginners. I imagine that the videos were shot in very different times, so you can clearly see the difference on the set up of the professor’s OS. Sometimes the the audio is a little low, but overall you can understand everything. Nonetheless, the lectures were pretty good.

## Middle
In one of the sections they even touch a little brief on web development although the course was not intended to it, so that would a little plus. If you don’t know anything about web development, you’ll probably be clueless about what he’s talking about, but for more intermediate developers could be interesting. (Just a note, this was entirely about Meteor.js + React, but really superficial)

On the following section, the professor focuses on setting up a web server (Apache), a database in SQL and No-SQL, everything that would be extremely useful for php developers, so if you’re interested in php, then go for it.

The professor also touches a little bit on Python, but it’s very confusing if you’re a beginner. I would say that the lectures that touches on anything besides Linux would probably make the student confused/overwhelmed since they would know absolutely nothing of what the professor is doing. Also, because the course is not for web development or Python, he goes  coding on it instead of maybe taking the time to explain why would you like (or not) to try web development or Python.

## End
At the end of the course, the professor focuses on Network and starts using some commands without explaining clearly the purpose of it. I would say that the last part of the course is very confusing, because he goes very fast on the explanation of the purpose of the the things he’s teaching, rather he focuses on showing you the commands.

I wouldn’t recommend the course since the explanations of why you should run those kinds of the commands were not that good. I think they can improve a lot on the audio, the explanations and update the content. There’s a lot of potential on this course and I believe they could improve it.
